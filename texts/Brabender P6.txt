6.3.1 General description, measuring principle 
Fold-down rails Pa The Brabender® conical twin screw extruder KDSE is a measuring 
head with electric heating connected via a spiral tooth gear clutch to 
and driven by a Brabender® Plastograph® EC Plus* or a Brabender® 
Plasti-Corder® Lab-Station*. 
The Brabender® conical twin screw extruder KDSE consists of the 
following main components: 
- processing unit with barrel, feed hopper, screws*, heating shells, 
and threaded ring for connecting various die heads* 
- gear unit with clutch 
- mobile frame* or docking station* (depending on the drive unit*) 
The conical twin screw extruder KDSE is used in laboratories and 
simulation for testing the extrusion behavior of products which are 
processed mainly in twin screw extruders in production as well. The 
KDSE stands out for special process technical advantages: 
- good intake behavior in particular with voluminous bulk goods 
due to the enlarged channel volume in the feed zone 
- quick compression in the feed zone through decreasing channel 
volume 
- quick pressure build-up and rapid fusion with high circumferential 
speeds within this functional zone 
- short processing length 
- transmission of high torques due to good space conditions in the 
bearing area 
The product is molten within the hot processing unit, homogenized, 
and conveyed by the screws* to the dies* on the discharge side. 
During this process, various parameters can be measured and 
recorded for subsequent evaluation. 
The measuring data are displayed during the running test on the 
monitor* of the computer* and can be stored and printed on a 
connected printer”.

Connect cooling air from the compressed air network (oil-free air, 
approx. 0.5 - 1.5 bars). 
NOTICE 
Risk of property damage! 
Extremely low cooling water or cooling air temperature may cause 
condensate formation in the gear unit and in the feed zone. 
in case of extremely low gear temperatures, cold transmission may 
cool down the screws* in the feed zone so that the time for reaching 
stationary conditions may be rather long. 
The gear oil viscosity may increase in case of very low 
temperatures. This may cause problems with gear lubrication and, 
in extreme cases, cause damage to the bearings in the gear unit. 
> Only use cooling water or cooling air from the normal

8.10.4.1 Cooling water connection for gear cooling 
Q Usually, gear cooling is required only in case of continuous 
operation with intensive machine use, i.e. in case of extensive 
test series with high gear stress, or at processing temperatures 
of approx. 200°C or higher. 
@ For gear cooling, water or air can be connected to the gear 
cooling flanges.

86 Conical twin screw extruder KDSE Mark III (counter-rotation)8 MOUNTING 
NOTICE 
Risk of property damage! 
Extremely low cooling water or cooling air temperature may cause 
condensate formation in the gear unit and in the feed zone. 
in case of extremely low gear temperatures, cold transmission may 
cool down the screws* in the feed zone so that the time for reaching 
stationary conditions may be rather long. 
The gear oil viscosity may increase in case of very low 
temperatures. This may cause problems with gear lubrication and, 
in extreme cases, cause damage to the bearings in the gear unit. 
> Only use cooling water or cooling air from the normal 
water/cooling water or compressed air net for gear cooling! 
> Do not use a cold air generator or similar apparatus! 
4) If required, connect water or air for gear cooling as follows: 
@ Textile hoses are stronger than simple plastic hoses 
and should, therefore, be preferred. 
© Water cooling: 
Use two suitable hoses (inner diameter 9 - 10 mm) to 
connect cooling water (0.2 - 0.5 ¥min & approx. 12 - 30 i/h) 
from the water or cooling water supply net to the two gear 
cooling flanges on the left side of the gear housing (seen in 
processing direction, see Fig. 8-49). 
Gh In order to avoid air bubbles in the cooling pipes, 
connect the hoses as follows: 
Supply: bottom flange 
Discharge: top flange 
@ In case of water cooling, the gear unit and the 
feed zone of the KDSE can also be cooled in 
series from a single connection (gear unit first, 
feed zone second), or via a T-piece. 
e Air cooling:
